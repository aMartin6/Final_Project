# Final_Project

* This project examines the behavior of earthquakes. It uses a block and spring model to represent two of earth's plates sliding past each other. The main purpose of the experiment is to analyze the frequency and magnitude of earthquakes over time and determine whether they exhibit self-organized criticality.
* The main file in this project uses the packages numpy and pylab. The main results and plots were calculated over a very large timeframe, and their purpose is to depict earthquake motion.
* (insert examples)  
* This project was written by Adrian Martin.
