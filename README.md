# Final_Project

This project models earthquake behavior using the block spring model proposed by Burridge and Knopoff. This model uses blocks and springs to represent the behavior of two of earth's plates at a fault line. The main purpose of the experiment is to compare the output of this model to real-life phenomena, and analyze the frequency and magnitude of earthquakes over time and determine the nature of self-organized criticality. 
  
The main file in this project uses the packages numpy and pylab. The main results and plots were calculated over a very large timeframe, and their purpose is to depict the motion of the system over time.  
  
For example, this code was used to calculate the motion of the blocks in the block-spring model when there was variation in the masses of the blocks, and when there wasn't.
