# Final_Project

This project models earthquake behavior using the one-dimensional block spring model proposed by Burridge and Knopoff. The main purpose of the numerical simulations is to compare the output of this model to statistics gathered from real earthquakes. This model is also used analyze the frequency and magnitude of earthquakes over time and help understand the nature of self-organized criticality. 

Cases studied:
* 25 blocks with varied initial positions
* 100 blocks with varied initial positions
* 100 blocks with varied initial positions and masses

Cases yet to try:
* Varying spring constants 
* Different friction functions
